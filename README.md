# Society of Tomorrow
#### _Evolution of world's population - visualized_

### Background and Overview

Society of Tomorrow is an animated demonstration of how composition of a country's population is distributed among age groups and how it is evolving from mid-20th century and well into 2050.

Users will be able to look up nearly any country of interest on Earth and get visual explanation of where the country's society is moving backed by real-life data accumulated by U.S. Census Bureau.

Society of Tomorrow will require the following for comprehensive implementation:

- [ ] Ability to seamlessly look up a country of interest, assisted by autocomplete.
- [ ] Properly structured AJAX queries to U.S. Census Bureau's API endpoint.
- [ ] Conversion of raw JSON into data-set ready to be fed into a chart algorithm.
- [ ] Mapping and rendering of a chart using D3.js library with an ability to re-render when new data is passed.
- [ ] Triggered animation causing timed re-rendering of the chart that would visualize population distribution and its comparison starting with the earliest year available and into 2050.
- [ ] Start, pause, restart the animation.
- [ ] Manual selection of a year using slider.
- [ ] Hover over slice of chart showing numbers behind the calculation.
